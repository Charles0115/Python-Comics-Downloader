Search_List_Downloader
USER INPUT:
1. location of the comics (folder to be downloaded)
2. String in the search bar (%20 is space bar)
3. Initial position and final position.
    a. Two boxes, one is "Start", one is "End".
    b. If user doesn't specify both, then it means all comics displayed. That is, if user lets both boxes empty.
    c. If user specifies "Start" and leaves "End" blank, it means to download from the "Start" specified to the end of the list.
    d. If user specifies "End" and leaves "Start" blank, it means to download from the first one in the list to the "End" specified.
    e. If user specifies both "Start" and "End", it means to download from the "Start" specified to "End" specified.
    IMPORTANT: Be very careful on the slice. We may need some modifications. Count the first one as "0".
4. If anything wrong happened (Ex. internet gone down, no connection, robot detection, etc), will the program inform the user?
5. If the program shuts down improperly, program will return the current state (that is, which comics in the list, which issue, which page).
   The user do not have to anything since if the user reruns the program, it will overwrites the unfinished files.
6. WebDriverWait waiting time.
